# Readme Opener

**Readme Opener** is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically opens the `README.md` file in preview mode whenever you open a project. This is useful for developers who want to quickly view project documentation without manually searching for the file.

## Features

- Automatically opens `README.md` file when opening a project
- Displays `README.md` directly in Markdown preview mode
- Simple and intuitive configuration
- Multiple workspace support
- Performance optimized
- Works with any project structure

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to Extensions tab (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for **"Readme Opener"**
4. Click **Install** to add the extension
5. Restart VS Code to activate the extension

## How to Use

The extension works automatically after installation - no configuration needed. When you open any project containing a `README.md` file, it will:

1. Detect the README file
2. Open it in a new editor tab
3. Switch to preview mode for optimal readability

## Troubleshooting

If the README doesn't open automatically:

1. Check if the extension is enabled
2. Verify that a `README.md` file exists in your project root
3. Try reloading the VS Code window
